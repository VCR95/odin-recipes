    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While there are a few steps to this lasagna recipe, it&#39s easy to make and has so much flavor.
        This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well either before or after baking!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Cheese Filling</b>: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with
            seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in
            this recipe!
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Meat</b>: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a Â¼
            teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sauce</b>: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it&#39s easy to make from
            scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you&#39s prefer).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9x13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles
            and sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
